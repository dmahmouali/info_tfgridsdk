# Capacity layer

The lowest layer of the ThreefoldGrid is its capacity layer. Raw internet capacity is exposed to the grid through nodes running the [0-OS operating system](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos).

0-OS provides 4 primitives that can be combined together to build full applications.

The 5 primitives available at the moment are:

- [Container](capacity_container.md): allow to run application inside containers
- [Overlay network](capacity_network.md): overlay network to connect all the primitives between nodes
- [Kubernetes cluster](capacity_kubernetes.md): full kubernetes cluster
- [0-DB namespace](capacity_0db.md): low lever key-value store
- [Container volume](capacity_vdisk.md): direct access to raw disk from a container
