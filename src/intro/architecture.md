## Architecture in general

### Built by many for anyone
The peer2peer nature is embedded in the architecture by the token economy.  The technology stack is open source and allows anyone to participate as a producer or a consumer of capacity.  Capacity producers (Farmers) create compute, storage and network utility by which they mint the digital currency called TFT.  Capacity consumers use capacity to create digital services and architect IT worklaods.  The only accepted currency for the consumed capacity is the TFT.  So the architecture is from the ground up a peer to peer techonlogy

### Use cases

The technology stack aims to be a universal substrate (build by many for anyone) for generic IT workloads.  Any (linux based) workload can be ported to the substrate and use capacity (compute, storage and networking) spread over many devices.  These devices can exists in traditional  datacenters, but also in other locations where people have opted in to be a capacity provider.

Use cases span a gamma of different industries and specific purposes but the ones that show most early adopter interest are blockchain projects who habve a needs to break out of the capcitivity of the current internet (cloud ) provider monopolies.  Many project relay for more than 50% of their "distributed" and "decentralised" blockchain nodes infrastructure on a hand full of market leader in the cloud world.  They welcome a distributed anc decentralised architecture like [cloud.threefold.io](http://cloud.threefold.io) offers/

### How does it all work under the hood?

The technology stack creates autonomous IT capacity that produces usable slices of capacity in a very efficient way. The operating system that fuels these nodes is called [zero OS](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zos) and is a lightweight single purpose operating system.  It exposes all available peripheals in the nodes and announces the available capacity in a so called explorer.
