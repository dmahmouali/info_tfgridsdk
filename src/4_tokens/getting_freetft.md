To receive FreeTFT you will need to meet a few prerequisites:

1. You need a stellar based wallet
2. It needs to be funded with a little XLM to set up a trustline

For this example, we will use interstellar.exchange to receive our FreeTFTâ€™s but any stellar based wallet will support FreeTFT. Please refer to the wallet of your choice on how to add assets.
