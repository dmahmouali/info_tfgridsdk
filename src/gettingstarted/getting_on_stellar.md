## Getting your 3bot connect to the Stellar network

The 3Bot Connect app has a Wallet inside, accessed using either the seed keys of the 3Bot connect app or an imported seed key. 

This wallet uses these keys to access the Stellar network. 
Both TFT and FreeTFT are registered on this blockchain, under the domain threefold.io . 

Threefold token is registered under : 
- AssetCode TFT
- Issuer GBOVQKJYHXRR3DX6NOX2RRYFRCUMSADGDESTDNBDS6CDVLGVESRTAC47

FreeTFT is a separate token with : 
- AssetCode FreeTFT
- Issuer GCBGS5TFE2BPPUVY55ZPEMWWGR6CLQ7T6P46SOFGHXEBJ34MSP6HVEUT

The wallet allows you to show your balance in TFTs and FreeTFTs, as well as transferring (sending and receiving) tokens. 

## How to get an account on Stellar

Accounts need to be activated on the Stellar network. 
You can do this doing the following steps :

- send an sms with the 5 character code to the shown sms number
