# StellarX

StellarX is a free peer2peer marketplace available on the Stellar network. It offers trading for a range of assets, using stellar lumens (XLM) as the base currency. 

# Buy TFT through StellarX

If you would like to start playing with the TF Grid today, you can purchase ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) through StellarX. 

## How does this work?
You can buy TFT only through Stellar Lumens (XLM), for now.

- We have set up a trading bot on StellarX which sells TFT against XLM.
- The price defined at the start is expressed in XLM but represents a value of about 0.15 USD. 
- This will allow people to buy real TFT on Stellar with their own wallets.
- Stellar TFT are provided by the Threefold Foundation, who can be recognized by the mentioned issuer code. 
- TFT as available on TFchain will be convertible into Stellar TFT. Once converted (conversion mechanism available as from end of April 2020 in the 3Bot connect app), TFChain TFTs will be burned on TFChain. 

## How do I get started?
1. First, you'll need to get yourself one of the Stellar-compatible wallets listed [here](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets).

As an example, [here](tftlobstr.md) you can find how to set up TFT in a Lobstr mobile wallet. 

2. Next, you will need to trust TFT, which will be issued. Everyting is credit on Stellar.

    _The Bot will connect to the Kraken exchange to find the price of XLM and will modify sell orders to match 0.15 USD (the price of the TFT)._
