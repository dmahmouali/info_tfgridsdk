# Installing the SDK for MacOS

## Local installation

### Prerequisites for the SDK installation.

In order to install the SDK in a container (recommended) you should have the Docker software suite. You can find instructions for most operating systems [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Note** the latest release of Docker Desktop for MacOS seems to have issues and the installer does not work for that.  If you have an older version of the docker Desktop the install might work.  Issue has been created and you can track it on [GitHub](https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core/issues/672). 

If you still want to start on your mac we propose for now to use Virtualbox and install an Ubuntu server on it. you can find Virtualbox [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/.Downloads) and the uUuntu server image [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).  Once you have the virtual box VM with Ubuntu servers you can follow the instructions to install the SDK [here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/info_threefold/blob/development/docs/wikieditors/installation_linux.md).

Also you need to have Python installed on your machine.  For MacOS we recommend using the package manager [```brew```](https://brew.sh/), but there are regular installers for MacOS as well.  Here we assume that you have installed brew and install all the necessary packages:
```bash
brew install python3
```
After installation, you can do a check with 
```bash
$ brew info python3 
python: stable 3.7.7 (bottled), HEAD
... will output some info
```

Next to this, we need a few additional libraries for the installation:

```bash
pip3 install click requests;
```

Then we need an sshkey to facilitate secure and easy access to the 3bot container.
```bash
# Load the ssh agent
eval `ssh-agent -s`
# Skip the ssh-keygen command in case you already have a ssh key for your root account.
ssh-keygen
# Adds private key identities to the OpenSSH authentication agent
ssh-add
# Show the public key that belongs to the loaded private key
ssh-add -L
```

The last command should show the public key
```bash
sh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC05P5eFki+5vHdn9BMrQwj0LZzl4FxwTAQ4GtwJFTS4Hog10Ly9sdhPQANOWASC1FXwZThVzj91hL8JCFuBZ5pDx29rJCDMQdqqVHQI5j8qkh4ZNNNQr/QLxdGl53RtQgabGe0OSn +ZdvGHuSQdTg03bomGrpCYcdsdsdsdsdnW0AHeMR0lEubbKMSQrTNCuZqrGbRPuxaHzWj9KQSe4xiRtA/PB7ccMsQlXeIh5pv8QI6k858oJzvlswczTgZivCKoHRnU6XyDVd60y9v3BpbB7YgTasw/VXUDt4oH7U61VI3Jy7t/d9jazMcDt3CngDtRpWQqZSO77 .ssh/id_rsa
root@happy:~# 
```

### Step 2:  TFGrid SDK installation

In a terminal, execute the commands below. This will download the installer and change its permission to make it executable.  In MacOS this install can be done as a normal user, you do not need to be root (no sudo -i required as with the Ubuntu installation).
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core/development/install/jsx.py?$RANDOM > /tmp/jsx;
chmod +x /tmp/jsx;
```

This script provides a number of commands to operate / configure the SDK.  Options are show with the ```--help``` flag.

```bash
root@happy:~ /tmp/jsx --help
Usage: jsx [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

## Install Threebot
<!--
TODO #10 Content to add representing the Jumpscale SDK install

As the installation is not completing still needs to be finished when the install works.
-->
Then we can install our Threebot using
```bash
# Make sure there are no remnissents from previous versions and installations.
/tmp/jsx containers-reset
# install tfgrid sdk
/tmp/jsx sdk
```
