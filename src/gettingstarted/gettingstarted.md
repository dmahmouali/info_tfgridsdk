# Getting started

To get your workloads up and running you will need to meet a few prerequisites.

All of them are pretty straightforward and you will be able to start your journey shortly.


- As a first step, you need to get yourself a **3bot.connect** identity.  This can be done by downloading the app on your smartphone and creating yourself an identity.  Please be aware that this is to be your digital identity on the grid, and holds the keys to access it.  The app provides you with access to  ThreeFold social media platforms, has a wallet for managing TFT's and provides support access.  The app can be found on the Google Play store and Apple Appstore.
- In the second step, you need to install the TFGrid SDK (and get access to it by your 3bot.connect).  The Jumpscale Software Development Kit is available for local installation and will be available for grid deployment (with secure web access).  For local installations we use Docker container technology to run the SDK software locally. Going forward we recommend to move to the TF Grid based version as this will provide you access from all web browsers on any device.
- Last you will need TFT tokens in your 3bot.connect app. There are two type of token available (2020 H1):  FreeTFT's and TFT's. The FreeTFT's are meant for developers and interested parties to testdrive the TF grid.

## Install The TFGrid SDK

The TFGrid SDK is the interface where you get access in different ways to build and deploy digital services on the peer2peer grid.  
You can install your TFGrid SDK hosted on the TFGrid, or on a local OS, for this manual we consider you use the SDK on your own machine.
