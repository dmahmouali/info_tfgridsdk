### What do I need to install the SDK?

Installing the Jumpscale SDK is easy.  There are two ways available today and there will be a third one very soon:

- Install the SDK on your local machine by using the `3sdk` binary 
- Compile and install the `3sdk` binary and install the SDK on you local machine
- Install the SDK on the TF Grid (later Q2 2020)

To install the Jumpscale SDK on you local systems you have to have the following software components installed on your machine

- The Docker Desktop.  You can find and download an appropriate version of the Docker Desktop  [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- The Chrome browser.  You can find the latest version [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

Today the Jumpscale SDK is supported on two main operating systems: Linux and macOS.  A version for windows will follow very soon (later Q2 2020)
